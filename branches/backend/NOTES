Rework of RBNB backend
-Change monitor to use Request("newest") with a sleepy loop.
-Change postData to only send channel map and have applications

-Cleanup thread issues. Put all changes to the controller in a

-Check to see why the channel list is refreshing so much and
 repetively changing the location bar
 
UI
-Make the location bar more stable in where the time is
