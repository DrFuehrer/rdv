Rework of RBNB backend
-Change monitor to use Request("newest") with a sleepy loop.
-Change postData to only send channel map and have applications
 display data when the time is posted.
-Cleanup thread issues. Put all changes to the controller in a
 thread safe list and check this on each iteration after
 displaying data. Keep the interupt flag for certain operations
 on the controller (stop, set location, etc...)
-Check to see why the channel list is refreshing so much and
 repetively changing the location bar
 
UI
-Make the location bar more stable in where the time is

Procedure
-Startup with no location (default time scale and domain)
-When adding first channel, set location to end time of that channel
-When adding any channel set the location bar ranges based on metadata
-When adding any channel, load data for location and domain
-When removing a channel, let data panel remove data. Update location bar range
