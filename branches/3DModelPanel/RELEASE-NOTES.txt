RDV 2.0.0 Release Candidate 1 Release Notes

RDV is a visualization environment for scientific and engineering data. Built on
top of the RBNB dynamic data server, it supports local and remote data sources
and can visualize numeric, video, image, and audio data in a number of different
ways.

See http://rdv.googlecode.com/ for information on RDV.

This release contains a new Spectrum Analyzer panel visualizing data in the
frequency domain. And the ability to add local channels that are functions of
other channels.

new dial visualization, and support for exporting MATLAB files. A number of
smaller improvements for plotting have been added in addition to a few bug
fixes.

NEW FEATURES

  - Support for zooming and panning of an image. A clickable navigation image
    can be used to jump around parts of an image when zoomed in. [2]
  - Filmstrip interface to view images sequentially. [3]
  - Support for viewing a thumbnail of an image to conserve bandwidth. [3]
  - DialViz, a visualization extension to view a numeric data channel on a dial.
    [22]
  - Export of data to the MATLAB MAT-file format. [23]
  - Support for port knocking authentication. [11]

IMPROVEMENTS

  - Cursors on an XY plot to indicate the current data point in a series. [1]
  - Zooming out of a plot via the mouse will remember previous zoom levels. [15]
  - Support for PNG and GIF images. [24]
  - Ability to hide the legend in a plot. [13]

BUG FIXES

  - Can't connect to RBNB server with circular references. [4]
  - Children of shortcut servers aren't shown in channel list. [5]
  - Auto adjusting the domain axis in a time series plot does not work
    correctly. [16]

CHANGES

  - Plots set to auto range, don't always include zero anymore. [25]
  - The system look & feel is used now, so RDV should look more native to the
