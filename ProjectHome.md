RDV is a visualization environment for scientific and engineering data. Built on top of the [Data Turbine](http://code.google.com/p/dataturbine/) dynamic data server, it supports local and remote data sources and can visualize numeric, video, image, and audio data in a number of different ways. RDV can be extended to support new types of data or visualize data in new ways. RDV is free software and can be used without restriction according to the conditions of the [license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
