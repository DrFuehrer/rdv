and the application should compile and run. This will pop up 
the application with a channel list on the left 
and a control interface on the top. Select "File->Connect" and 
specify a RBNB server to connect to and click "connect". 
To add channels, go to the 
channel list and double click the channel you want to view. 
Then either monitor with the RT button or drag the location bar 
to where you want it and click play (">"). The time scale bar 
controls how fast playback is. The domain scroll bar controls 
the size of the time axis on the plots, there is no effect on 
the video. The data plotter supports multiple channels, so you 
can drag additional channels onto it. To close a data panel 
click the "X" in the upper right hand corner, this is a little 
broken but just click there and it should work. If you click 
anywhere else in a data panel, the panel will detach and become 
its own window. To reattach the data panel just click it again.
