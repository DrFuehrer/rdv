The bugs here are categorized into two categories. Stable for bugs affecting the
current release, or code that will be released soon. And development for code
that is not ready for public released.

------
Stable
------
-The time series data panel doesn't display correctly when the time scale is
 smaller than the playback rate (doesn't affect RT mode)
-When a data panel is closed it is not releasing its memory. Or maybe better yet
 the VM isn't releasing memory back to the OS.
-When dragging a channel onto an existing data panel the state doesn't change to
 loading when the data is being fetched.

Development

-Snapshot doesn't work for time series data panel.
-When the jfreechart data panels are unpinned, they don't always show the icons
 with a mouseover.
