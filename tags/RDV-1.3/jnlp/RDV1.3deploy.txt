RDV 1.3 Deploy Guide

SUMMARY
The RDV application is offered as a Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP)
application, which offers great convenience and usability to the user
in that RDV can be run by a simple mouse click in a web browser. All
that is required by a client is installation of the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 1.5.
This procedure is now much simpler than it has been in previous versions,
as RDV.jar now contains all of its dependencies and is completely
self-contained.
JNLP requires that apllication be "signed", which means that a
cryptographic digital signature has been applied to the application archive
(RDV.jar, in this case). NEESit has signed RDV.jar for convenience. This
will have the effect of querying users about their acceptance of SDSC's
signature when they launch RDV.

PROCEDURE
1. Obtain the RDV JNLP package (RDV1.3.0jnlp.zip) from here:
<link>
2. Unzip the file to generate a directory, "rdv13", which contains the
files RDV.jar and RDV.jnlp.
3. These files must be placed under the webroot of the webserver from which
RDV will be offered. Simply moving the "rdv13" directory into the webroot 
will certainly suffice.
4. Edit the file "RDV.jnlp" to indicate the correct URL where the RDV.jnlp
is deployed in the "codebase" field. This is indicated by text "PUT RDV
URL HERE".
5. Provide a link to the RDV jnlp file somewhere in the webspace to make it
available to users via http. For example:
<a href="URL OF RDV.JNLP">RDV 1.3.0</a>
An indication that JRE 1.5 is required in the text of this web page somewhere
near this link is recommended.
