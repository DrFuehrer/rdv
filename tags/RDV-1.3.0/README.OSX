There are a couple acrobatics required to get RDV building/running under the
OSX implementation of Java. This is a side-effect of packaging the RDV jar to
contain all of its own dependencies, since it now wants to include some Java
system classses. I tried this with ln, but had an issue with jnlp which was
corrected by brute-force cp'ing.

cp /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/CurrentJDK/Classes/classes.jar
   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/CurrentJDK/Home/lib/rt.jar

cp /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/CurrentJDK/Classes/classes.jar
