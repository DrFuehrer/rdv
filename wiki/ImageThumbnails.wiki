#summary How to configure a Data Turbine server to enable thumbnail viewing in RDV
#labels Documentation-Admin

== Introduction ==

An image channel can have a thumbnail image channel associated with it. This is done using the `ThumbNailPlugIn` distributed with Data Turbine. When this plugin is started, RDV can use it to display a thumbnail image instead of a full resolution image. This can be used to save bandwidth when you are not interested in the full resolution image

== Starting the Thumbnail Plugin ===

The thumbnail plugin can be started in two different ways. Via Web Turbine or via the command line. Both take the same set of options.

=== Plugin Options ===

The following options can be passed to plugin when starting it.

|| *Description*             || *Command line* || *Default*      ||
|| RBNB Server Address       || -a             || localhost:3333 ||
|| !PlugIn Name              || -n             || !ThumbNail     ||
|| JPEG Source/Channel       || -c             ||                ||
|| Image Scale Factor (0-4)  || -s             || 0.5            ||
|| Image Quality (0-1)       || -q             || 0.5            ||
|| Maximum Number of Images  || -M             || 10             ||

If no source or channel is specified, the plugin will thumbnail all image channels. To limit the thumbnailing to specific sources or channels, specify a source or channel.

=== Starting Via Web Turbine ===

To start the plugin via Web Turbine, go to the Web Turbine web site for your Data Turbine server (http://hostname/webTurbine/) and click `Thumb Nail PlugIn`. From here you can set the various options for the plugin. The plugin name needs to be changed to `_Thumbnails` because this is what RDV is hard coded to look for. The other parameters can be tweaked for the desired usage. Click `Start PlugIn` to start the plugin.

=== Starting Via the Command Line ===

To start the plugin via the command line, replace `$RBNB_HOME` with the root Data Turbine directory, and execute the following command:

 `java -cp $RBNB_HOME/bin/rbnb.jar:$RBNB_HOME/apache-tomcat-5.5.12/webapps/webTurbine/WEB-INF/classes/ ThumbNailPlugIn -n _Thumbnails`

The other plugins options listed above may be used, but they are optional.

== Viewing Thumbnails in RDV ==

Once the plugin is started, RDV will automatically detect that the plugin is running. To switching to viewing a thumbnail, right click the image to bring up the popup menu and select `Use thumbnail image`.
